            <p>People priortize getting things done. I am tired. This is a website where nothing is actually ever able to be completed. I took inspiration from a past professor, Diana Shpungin, who analyzed things that were broken and mended. I wanted to create a website that was "broken" in that any task added can not be completed and will just stay there for your time on the page. I hope you enjoy the website, and remember, you can never truly finish anything.
